# openEHR Model Examples

This repository contains examples of openEHR models (archetypes, templates, etc.) used for demonstration and testing.

The directory structure mirrors the `/local` directory of the [openEHR CKM-mirror](https://github.com/openEHR/CKM-mirror) repository, but without files initially.
Only ones needed as examples are then manually added.

The following structure was created with minimal README files in each directory:

```
local/
  archetypes/
    cluster/
    composition/
    demographic/
    entry/
      action/
      admin_entry/
      evaluation/
      instruction/
      observation/
  section/
templates/
  cluster/
  composition/
  entry/
  section/
termsets/
```
